# tRPC, Next Auth, and Tanstack Query Starter Repository

This is the starter code for the series of lectures on tRPC, Next Auth, and Tanstack Query. Each lecture will build out a separate part of a basic, and therefore has a separate `solution` / `starter` folders. All other parts of the application (such as the database schema) are shared.
  

1. **tRPC on the Server**: Fill in starter code in `src/server/api/routers` to create a tRPC API.

2. **Next Auth**: Fill in starter code in `src/server/api/middleware` to create middlewares to handle authentication and authorization for our trpc api.

3. **Tanstack Query**: Fill in starter code in `src/app/_components` to create frontend React components that interact with the API.
